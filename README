This library contains a light-weight HTTP server for serving web-sites
using OCaml.  It uses the co-operatively threaded cohttp [1] library
to process HTTP.  It consists of:

* htmlgen/ has a Markdown processor and other helper functions for
generating HTML

* server/ is a full daemon implementation with MIME and other
functions for serving web sites

* crunch/ has a utility called "mlcrunch" which converts a directory
of static files into a standalone ML file which can serve them up
directly from memory. Useful for grabbing templates.

* fs2b/ uses the ORM library to convert a directory tree into a
database with (name * body), to save memory for large binaries.

This library is originally based on the "do it yourself OCaml HTTP"
daemon by Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@cs.unibo.it>, and since adapted
to LWT and Mirage by:
  Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> 
  David Sheets <dsheets@alum.mit.edu>
