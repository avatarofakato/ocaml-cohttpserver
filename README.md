This library contains a light-weight HTTP server for serving web-sites
using OCaml.  It uses the co-operatively threaded cohttp [1] library
to process HTTP.

--
This library is originally based on the "do it yourself OCaml HTTP"
daemon by Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@cs.unibo.it>, and since adapted
to LWT and Mirage by:
  Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> 
  David Sheets <dsheets@alum.mit.edu>
